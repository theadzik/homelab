# homelab

My playground :)

* `backups` - Running backups for VaultWarden and uploading to Google Drive
* `cv` - My resume built with Jekyll
* `dns` - Dynamic DNS updater working with `spaceship.com`
* `manifests` - My RaspberryPi 5 k3s cluster config.

## TODO

* Dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana?)
* pre-commit hooks (yamllint, isort, flake8)
* CI/CD (GH Actions + ArgoCD?)
* Get better storage for persistent files
