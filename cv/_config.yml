about_content: |
  As a Senior DevOps Engineer specializing in **Kubernetes** and **Azure Cloud**,
  I offer a wealth of experience in designing and implementing secure, cost-effective cloud solutions.
  Proficient in orchestrating **containerized applications** and adhering to the **Everything as Code** philosophy,
  I consistently seek ways to enhance performance, reliability, and financial efficiency of all systems.

  My expertise involves active participation in platform engineering, utilizing **Python**, **PowerShell**, and **Bash** for automation,
  along with industry-standard tools such as **Terraform**, **Helm**, and **Docker**.

  In my free time, I enjoy tinkering and experimenting with my personal Kubernetes cluster built on Raspberry Pi.
  It's a hands-on hobby that not only serves as a platform for exploration but also hosts various applications, such as this resume,
  showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and technical proficiency beyond the professional realm.

      In my free time, I like messing around with my personal Kubernetes cluster.
      I use it to host things like a password manager, a DNS server, and even this resume.
      You can check out the code on [theadzik/homelab](https://github.com/theadzik/homelab).

      I'm into staying active, especially long-distance running.
      I'm proud of hitting milestones like the Crown of the Polish Half Marathons and finishing a Warsaw Marathon.

      On a different note, I'm a big Formula 1 fan and have been watching since 2006.
      I got to attend the Austrian Grand Prix in 2019, and it was awesome!
