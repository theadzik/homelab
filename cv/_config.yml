  As a Senior DevOps Engineer specializing in **Kubernetes** and **Azure Cloud**,
  I offer a wealth of experience in designing and implementing cost-effective cloud solutions.
  Proficient in orchestrating **containerized applications** and adhering to the **Everything as Code** philosophy,
  I excel in optimizing systems for performance, reliability, and financial efficiency.

  My expertise involves active participation in platform engineering, utilizing **Python**, **PowerShell**, and **Bash** for automation.
  Tools like **Terraform** streamline deployment pipelines, contributing to continuous improvement.

  I consistently seek ways to enhance operational efficiency while ensuring scalability and sustainability.
